# PSO2es Tweaker UI

Just practicing flutter by making the UI for the PSO2es Tweaker.  The current version only has the bare minimums for the UI.  This tries to make the UI for the mobile app look closer to the PSO2 Tweaker for PC.  You can find out about the PSO2 Tweaker here: http://arks-layer.com/
